# Restricted materials

Restricted materials should be isolated in their own folders and labeled "RESTRICTED." Restricted folders do not necessarily need to be isolated in their own boxes if the restriction does not prohibit all access by researchers. Closed folders are always isolated in their own boxes and filed at the end of the collection.
