# Integrated Additions (series)

In some cases you will decide it is both efficient and more transparent to do some top level intellectual arrangement.  This may be the case when you have a large collection with an extensive contents list in which the addition is likely to be lost at the end for most researchers.  

You will add an "A" to the series number to indicate that it is an addition and include a parenthetical at the end to identify which addition (as collections can have many additions). You will also add <acqinfo> tags to indicate the accession number. In this example, there have been two additions to the correspondence series, one in March 2008 and one in April 2010. 

When you have material that falls outside the existing series, add a new one, with the "A" to indicate that it was part of an addition. In this example, a photographs series is new with the Addition of March 2008. 

> Note that these additions are not physically integrated with the original deposit.
