# AT

In addition to Proc_Rec, we also update the Archivist Toolkit accession record with very basic processing information. Fields that need updating are found under the following two tabs in an AT Accession Record: Basic Information and Acknowledgments, Restrictions, and Processing Tasks. 

### Basic Information Tab

Replace the accessions shelf locations in the General Accession Note field with the phrase "Reg Order" (leave UID for digital)

Acknowledgments, Restrictions, and Processing Tasks Tab 

- Change Processing Status to Processed  
- Check the Processed check box (yes, a little redundant)  
- Add the Processed Date. I have been using the date that I am filling in the information here, not the date that actual processing was finished.
