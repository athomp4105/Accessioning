# Processing Note: Statements

The Addition of November 2001 is arranged in the same way as, but has not been incorporated into, the original deposit of materials. 

Additions received after February 1995 have not been integrated into the original deposit. Researchers should always check additions to be sure they have identified all files of interest to them. 

The Addition has been intellectually integrated with the original deposit but is distinguishable by accession information.
