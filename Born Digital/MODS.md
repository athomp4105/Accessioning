# MODS requirements
 
We have a template built into the CDR. In admin view, you can get to it by clicking on the wheel to the right of a title at any level of a CDR collection:  

1. Click on "Edit Description" in the drop-down menu. 

2. Select "Archival Folder." 

In the template, you should always fill in:

1. The mods title (folder title)

2. The identifiers (accession number and digital folder number)

3. Related item (the URL for the finding aid)

There is a field for another related item, the original storage media, but it is not required and only entered by curatorial request. 

**Anything from the MODS template that isn’t needed should be removed. For example, if we are not recording the source media in the MODS record, we should delete that part of the template.**
