## Storage Media Description

What's this for?

- A description of the type of storage media can be used if it's important to the collection context that the user know the type of storage media a set of digital files was extracted from. This is particularly valuable if we are retaining the media as an object people can view in the reading room.  

- The storage media id, if there is one, is listed in the MODS metadata in the CDR, so it doesn't need to be in the finding aid. Images of the media may also accompany the collection in the CDR, but the images are often not public.  

- This will most often be used for legacy/obsolete storage media and not for other means of digital transfer.  

What's added to the finding aid?  

- Name of the storage media. Can be detailed and include brand information or size capacity or just generic types. For example:  

  - The digital files were extracted from 3.5in Floppy Disks and CDs.  

  - The digital files in this folder were extracted from Iomega 100MB zip disks.  
  
## File Format Description and Preservation Context

What's this for?

- File format information can be retrieved from the repository interface and the PREMIS metadata that is stored with each file, so a detailed listing of file formats is not necessary in the finding aid. However, a brief summary of file formats that will provide the user with valuable information about the collection (software used by a creator or sense of time period of creation) may be appropriate. The important thing is to not spend time listing format information that could easily be generated on demand via metadata in the CDR.  

> Remember that while the current CDR user interface doesn't always present the best file format metadata, the data is there. It's just not always readily apparent on the front end, but is available to staff in FITS extract.  

- If you choose to describe file formats in the collection, describe the original file formats as given to us by the donor.  If derivatives are created for access in the finding aid, create a <processinfo> statement at the file level.  

Standard Format Information to be used

- Use file format name.  

- Do not use just an extension. Extensions can be wrong. Not all extensions are well known.  

- The file format name(s) should be taken from FITS extract in the CDR or pre-ingest file format identification record.  

Where does it go?

- Series level note

- Folder/fild level note
