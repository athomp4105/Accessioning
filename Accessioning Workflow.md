# Before we begin

We enter accession records into ArchivesSpace for all archival material received in Wilson Library. When print materials that require bibliographic cataloging are received as part of a larger archival collection, include a note about the print materials (and where they can be found) in the accession record. Create a ticket with a link to the accession record and submit it to Tickets for Tech Services section of the TS ticketing system.

# Creating an Accession Record at the Wilson Special Collections Library

This documentation is supplemental to the documentation provided by ArchivesSpace, and has been adapted for use at the Wilson Special Collections Library. _"Maps to:" notes let you know where you would have entered the same information in AT._

> While entering data you should periodically click **Save Accession**. If any required element is missing, you will be prompted to add that information. Some fields have boilerplate text with instructions. You should delete the instructions as you create the record.

# Instructions

1. On the main toolbar, click **Create** and select Accession. 

2. ArchivesSpace requires two elements for an ArchivesSpace valid accession record. They are Identifier and Accession Date, which serve to document only the accession event.  

Other fields are used for accessions at the Wilson Special Collections Library, and should be filled out if required or as applicable. 

## Basic Information

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/76891925-309d8480-6860-11ea-9751-b826c7f28473.png "screenshot example basic info")

### Title (Required by TS)

_Maps to: Title (Basic Information tab)_

The title of the accession will typically, but need not always, match the title of the resource to which the accession belongs. For example, the accession title may be John Smith Diaries, which may become part of the larger Smith Family Papers.  

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

When spawning a resource (see below), this field maps to the resource title.

### Identifier (Required by ArchivesSpace)

_Maps to: Accession Number (Basic Information tab)_

Here's how we enter identifiers at the Wilson Special Collections Library: 

- **First component:** select the curatorial department from the drop-down list (GL, NCC, NCCPA, SHC, SFC, UA). 
- **Second component:** this number will autogenerate based on today's date.
- **Third component:** enter the collection number for the collection to which this accession will be added (example: #04534). _If you don't know the collection number at the time of accession, you can leave this component blank and fill it in later._

> Note that we are no longer creating separate accession records for digital items. 

### Accession Date (Required by ArchivesSpace)

_Maps to: Accession Date (Basic Information tab)_

When you create a new accession, this field is automatically filled with the current date, so you may need to edit that date to reflect the actual date of the accession transaction. The accession date in ArchivesSpace is meant to represent the date of the receipt of the materials, which is not necessarily the same as the date the accession record is created and most probably not the date that the contents of the accession were created. 

### Content Description (Required by TS)

_Maps to: Description (Accession Notes tab)_

A description of the document types and topical contents of the accession. When spawning a resource, this field maps to the main level scope and content note. 

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

### General Note

_Maps to: General Accession Note (Basic Information tab)_

Intended for notes about the acquisition or processing of the accession, and not about the accession itself. Can used as a place to record temporary locations. (examples: 206_7a.1 or BD lab). 

> Note that we will stop using this field to record temporary locations once we start using ArchivesSpace as our locations database. 

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

### Acquisition Type (Required by TS)

_Maps to: Acquisition Type (Accession Notes tab)_

Choose from a drop-down list. A categorical descriptor for the type of acquisition. We typically select _gift, purchase, or transfer._

### Resource Type (Required by TS)

_Maps to: Resource Type (Basic Information tab)_

Choose from a drop-down list. A list of terms for categorizing resources into basic types. We typically select _Collection, Papers, or Records._

### Restrictions Apply?

_Maps to: Restrictions Apply (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A selected check box indicates that restrictions apply. The restrictions can be explained using the Access Restrictions Note and/or Rights sub-records, described elsewhere below. 

### Publish?

Do not check this box. Just leave it alone. Pretend you never saw it.

### Access Restrictions

_Maps to: Access Restrictions (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A selected check box indicates that access to the materials is restricted. 

### Access Restrictions Note

_Maps to: Access Restrictions Note (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A statement indicating what materials in the accession have restrictions on access, what the authority of the restriction is, and for how long the restriction will be in effect. Additional information may also be recorded in a Rights sub-record. 

### Use Restrictions

_Maps to: Use Restrictions? (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab) _

A selected check box indicates that there are use restrictions for materials in the accession. The restrictions can be explained using the Use Restrictions Note and/or Rights sub-records, described below. 

### Use Restrictions Note

_Maps to: Use Restrictions Note  (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A statement indicating which materials have use restrictions, how the materials can be used, what the authority of the restriction is, and for how long the restriction will be in effect. Additional information may also be recorded in a Rights sub-record.

## Dates

_Maps to: Date Expression (Basic Information tab)_

This sub-record identifies and records the date(s) that pertain to the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described. The required fields are **Label, Type,  Date Expression.**

One Date sub-record will automatically appear as part of the accession record template. To create additional Date sub-records, click **Add Date** on the right side of the screen.

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/76894777-2b8f0400-6865-11ea-800e-ed6f1e7e2fd5.png "screenshot example dates")

### Label (Required by ArchivesSpace)

Choose from a drop-down list. Describes the type of activity that the date signifies. You will most likely always select _Creation._

### Expression (Required by TS)

The date or date range of the materials in the accession. Some examples: 1968; 1979-1993; 1785-1960; bulk 1916-1958; 1827; circa 1870-1879; 1906 March 1; undated. 

_Delete the boilerplate instruction!_

### Type (Required by ArchivesSpace)

Choose from a drop-down list. Indicate the type for normalized date information, either a single date or a date range (inclusive or bulk). The default is "Inclusive." 

### Certainty

Choose from a drop-down list. Indicate the level of confidence for the information given in a date statement. This information is optional and should only be added when you are qualifying date information as potentially uncertain based upon the description or cataloging rules in use.  

### Removing a Date sub-record:

1. Find the Date sub-record that is to be deleted.
2. Click on the **X** in the upper right corner of the Date sub-record link. 
3. Click on the **Confirm Removal** option to remove the Date sub-record from the accession record, or on the **Cancel** option to retain the sub-record. 
4. Click on **Save** in the context record to save the accession record with the Date sub-record removed. 

## Extents

_Maps to: Extent (Basic Information tab)_

This sub-record is used for recording the extent (items, volume, or containers) of the described materials. The required fields are Portion, Number, and Type. 

**You may add as many extent records as needed. This means that you can record physical and digital extents in the same record. Hooray! To do this, you will need to create more than one sub-record using the steps below.**

One Extent sub-record will automatically appear as part of the accession record template. To add an additional Extent sub-records, click **Add Extent** on the right side of the screen. 

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/76895739-f2579380-6866-11ea-93c0-b9509988dba7.png "screenshot example extent")

### Portion (Required by ArchivesSpace)

_Maps to: This is a new feature that does not map to AT_

Used to specify whether an extent statement relates to the whole or part of a given accession. Choose part or whole from the drop-down list. If you are recording multiple extents (for example, if you have 1 box of papers and 1 hard drive), you will need to create multiple sub-records. 

### Number (Required by ArchivesSpace)

_Maps to: Extent number (Basic Information tab)_

 A numeric value for indicating the number of units in the extent statement, e.g., 5, 11.5, 245. Used in conjunction with Type (below) to provide a structured extent statement. 
 
 ### Type (Required by ArchivesSpace)
 
 _Maps to: Extent number (Basic Information tab)_
 
 A term indicating the type of unit used to measure the extent of materials described (examples: items, linear feet, gigabytes). Choose from a drop-down list.  
 
 ### Container Summary (Required by TS)
 
 _Maps to: Container Summary (Basic Information tab)_
 
Serves to describe the logical or physical parts of a multi-level resource or digital object that makes up an aggregation of archival materials. Example of use: if the Number and Type are 10 linear feet, then the container summary might be used to record the actual number of containers (10 boxes and 4 flat files) 
 
_Delete boilerplate instructions!_

### Removing an Extent sub-record:

1. Find the Extent sub-record that is to be deleted.
2. Click on the **X** in the upper right corner of the Extent sub-record.
3. Click on the **Confirm Removal** option to remove the Extent sub-record, or on the **Cancel** option to retain the sub-record.
4. Click on **Save** in the context record to save the context record with the Extent sub-record removed.

## Agent [a.k.a. Names] Links

_Maps to: Names & Subjects tab_

This sub-record enables associating an agent as a creator, source, or subject to the materials being described, as a rights holder to a rights statement, as an agent responsible for a recorded event, and to other agents. 

> Note that we will be using agent records much more comprehensively in the future!

**Linking agent record(s) to a material description record:**

One or more agent records may be linked to a material description record as either a creator, a source, or a subject of the materials being description. You may add as many agent links as needed. Also, the same agent record may be linked to the same context record multiple times as long as the value recorded for **Role** and **Relator** are different for each link occurrence. In other words, an agent record may not be linked two or more times to the same context with the same **Role** value and same **Relator** value. 

To link an agent record to a material description record, click **Agent Links** on the left navigation bar and then click **Add Agent Link** on the right side of the screen.
