We enter accession records into ArchivesSpace for all archival material received in Wilson Library. When print materials that require bibliographic cataloging are received as part of a larger archival collection, include a note about the print materials (and where they can be found) in the accession record. Create a ticket with a link to the accession record and submit it to Tickets for Tech Services section of the TS ticketing system.

# Creating an Accession Record at the Wilson Special Collections Library

This documentation is supplemental to the documentation provided by ArchivesSpace, and has been adapted for use at the Wilson Special Collections Library. _"Maps to:" notes let you know where you would have entered the same information in AT._

> While entering data you should periodically click **Save Accession**. If any required element is missing, you will be prompted to add that information. Some fields have boilerplate text with instructions. You should delete the instructions as you create the record.

# Instructions

1. On the main toolbar, click **Create** and select Accession. 

2. ArchivesSpace requires two elements for an ArchivesSpace valid accession record. They are Identifier and Accession Date, which serve to document only the accession event.  

Other fields are used for accessions at the Wilson Special Collections Library, and should be filled out if required or as applicable. 

## Basic Information

[View screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/76891925-309d8480-6860-11ea-9751-b826c7f28473.png)

**Title (Required by TS)**

_Maps to: Title (Basic Information tab)_

The title of the accession will typically, but need not always, match the title of the resource to which the accession belongs. For example, the accession title may be John Smith Diaries, which may become part of the larger Smith Family Papers.  

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

When spawning a resource (see below), this field maps to the resource title.

**Identifier (Required by ArchivesSpace)** 

_Maps to: Accession Number (Basic Information tab)_

Here's how we enter identifiers at the Wilson Special Collections Library: 

- **First component:** select the curatorial department from the drop-down list (GL, NCC, NCCPA, SHC, SFC, UA). 
- **Second component:** this number will autogenerate based on today's date.
- **Third component:** enter the collection number for the collection to which this accession will be added (example: #04534). _If you don't know the collection number at the time of accession, you can leave this component blank and fill it in later._

> Note that we are no longer creating separate accession records for digital items. 

**Accession Date (Required by ArchivesSpace)**

_Maps to: Accession Date (Basic Information tab)_

When you create a new accession, this field is automatically filled with the current date, so you may need to edit that date to reflect the actual date of the accession transaction. The accession date in ArchivesSpace is meant to represent the date of the receipt of the materials, which is not necessarily the same as the date the accession record is created and most probably not the date that the contents of the accession were created. 

**Content Description (Required by TS)**

_Maps to: Description (Accession Notes tab)_

A description of the document types and topical contents of the accession. When spawning a resource, this field maps to the main level scope and content note. 

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

**General Note**

_Maps to: General Accession Note (Basic Information tab)_

Intended for notes about the acquisition or processing of the accession, and not about the accession itself. Can used as a place to record temporary locations. (examples: 206_7a.1 or BD lab). 

> Note that we will stop using this field to record temporary locations once we start using ArchivesSpace as our locations database. 

_Delete the boilerplate instructions!_

**Acquisition Type (Required by TS)**

_Maps to: Acquisition Type (Accession Notes tab)_

Choose from a drop-down list. A categorical descriptor for the type of acquisition. We typically select _gift, purchase, or transfer._

**Resource Type (Required by TS)**

_Maps to: Resource Type (Basic Information tab)_

Choose from a drop-down list. A list of terms for categorizing resources into basic types. We typically select _Collection, Papers, or Records._

**Restrictions Apply?**

_Maps to: Restrictions Apply (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A selected check box indicates that restrictions apply. The restrictions can be explained using the Access Restrictions Note and/or Rights sub-records, described elsewhere below. 

**Publish?**

_Do not check this box. Just leave it alone. Pretend you never saw it._

**Access Restrictions**

_Maps to: Access Restrictions (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A selected check box indicates that access to the materials is restricted. 

**Access Restrictions Note**

_Maps to: Access Restrictions Note (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A statement indicating what materials in the accession have restrictions on access, what the authority of the restriction is, and for how long the restriction will be in effect. Additional information may also be recorded in a Rights sub-record. 

**Use Restrictions**

_Maps to: Use Restrictions? (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab) _

A selected check box indicates that there are use restrictions for materials in the accession. The restrictions can be explained using the Use Restrictions Note and/or Rights sub-records, described below. 

**Use Restrictions Note**

_Maps to: Use Restrictions Note  (Acknowledgements, Restrictions & Processing Tasks tab)_

A statement indicating which materials have use restrictions, how the materials can be used, what the authority of the restriction is, and for how long the restriction will be in effect. Additional information may also be recorded in a Rights sub-record.
