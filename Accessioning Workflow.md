We enter accession records into ArchivesSpace for all archival material received in Wilson Library. When print materials that require bibliographic cataloging are received as part of a larger archival collection, include a note about the print materials (and where they can be found) in the accession record. Create a ticket with a link to the accession record and submit it to Tickets for Tech Services section of the TS ticketing system.

# Creating an Accession Record at the Wilson Special Collections Library

This documentation is supplemental to the documentation provided by ArchivesSpace, and has been adapted for use at the Wilson Special Collections Library. _"Maps to:" notes let you know where you would have entered the same information in AT._

> While entering data you should periodically click **Save Accession**. If any required element is missing, you will be prompted to add that information. Some fields have boilerplate text with instructions. You should delete the instructions as you create the record.

## Instructions

1. On the main toolbar, click **Create** and select Accession. 

2. ArchivesSpace requires two elements for an ArchivesSpace valid accession record. They are Identifier and Accession Date, which serve to document only the accession event.  

Other fields are used for accessions at the Wilson Special Collections Library, and should be filled out if required or as applicable.
