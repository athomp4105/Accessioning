# Arrangement

When assigned an accession containing AV, consult with the AV Archivist about how to best arrange the materials. It is crucial to have an arrangement plan in place before proceeding with item-level processing. Sometimes an arrangement plan is predetermined by the curatorial unit, but often determining an arrangement plan requires some of your own digging and gaining some familiarity with the collection materials.  

Generally, try to arrange materials by content, rather than by format. Exceptions to this may include production-heavy collections with defined works, or titles, that may benefit from having sub-groupings of like-format items in order to gain a sense of the creator's production process. An example of this includes the Tom Davenport Papers, http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20025   

Below are examples of arrangement methods of AV materials and when to use them: 

### Orignial Order:

When most of the materials have an existing original order, try to preserve this order. Original order can be identified with curatorial guidance, by obvious or visible original numbering schemes, published discographies, or from supplementary documentation provided by the creator and/or donor. Collections with original order often include record label collections, production-heavy collections, and collections compiled by the creators themselves. 

**Examples:**

Apollo Records Collection [arranged by record label issue #], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20539/ 

Peter Lowry Collection [subseries 2.1.1 arranged by the creator's numbering system], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20017/ 

### Chronological:

If you are dealing primarily with an event or program-based collection, including live performances and radio programs, or a collection that only has materials produced by a single creator, consider using chronological order. Chronological order only works as an arrangement method if most of the items have a date associated with them. If most of the materials in an event/program based or single-creator collection do not have any apparent dates, consider using alphabetical order to group like-events or programs by title.  

**Examples:**

McCabe's Guitar Shop Collection [live shows arranged chronologically by format], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20511/ 

FolkScene Collection [series 1 consists of radio programs arranged chronologically by production date], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20517/ 

### Alphabetical:

Use alphabetical order when original order or chronological order are not immediately apparent, or used consistently across the collection. If you are dealing primarily with performer-based recordings, alphabetize by performer’s last name. If you are dealing with event or program-based recordings, alphabetize by program or event titles, when apparent (ex1. Newport Folk Festival, Odetta ; ex2. Newport Folk Festival, Pete Seeger). 

**Examples:**

Greenhill Family/FLi Artists/Folklore Productions Collection [series 3 arranged alphabetically by artist or event], http://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/20542/
