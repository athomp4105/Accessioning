# Labeling and Putting Stuff Away (Work in Progress!)

_This section is a work in progress...stay tuned!_

## Rehousing Materials

Apart from moving image film, it is preferable to leave audiovisual materials in their original containers since these containers often contain information about the original stock, as well as container notes created by the creator or donor of the collection. Exceptions to this include original containers with severe preservation concerns, such as mold or an inability to properly contain the item at hand.  

Whenever an audiovisual material is rehoused, transcribe all titles and container notes from the original container into Jitterbug and photocopy or digitally photograph the original container. Place the photocopy or photograph in the collection’s control file or SFC’s Department Drive until proper procedures for documenting original containers are developed.  

Unlike audio and video formats, all moving image film is hand inspected, placed onto archival cores, and rehoused into archival cans. Consult the Audiovisual Archivist about film inspection and rehousing before proceeding with moving image materials.  

## Labeling

#### Create Small Item Labels

Once you have retrieved the correct call numbers, see “How to Create Item level AV Labels.docx” (_Louis\Southern Folklife Collection\Departmental Documents\Documentation\Archival Processing \How to Create Item Level AV Labels.docx_) and create labels using foil-back spine labels supplied by Technical Services.  

#### Physically Label Items

Labels for cartridge-based items, such as audiocassettes and videotape, are placed on the spine, while labels for open reel and audiodiscs, are placed on the top left front of the item. Labels for moving image film are created with the label maker located on level 10. More on label type and placement below.

#### Cartridge-based Item Labels

When possible for cartridge-based items, place item labels on the spine of the container. Cut labels to size when appropriate.
