# Items Separated

**Please note, this section is a bit out of date as of July 2019, although a lot of it is still relevant.  For our most up-to-date processing practices, please see the Physical Processing section, as well as the "Labels" section.**

## Z Style

Many of our items separated formats are housed "Z-style," which is our way of saying that items from several collections are housed in the same container, a la the Z collections. Z collections are collections that have five or fewer folders and are all housed together in document cases. That way we do not have half-empty document cases scattered through the stacks unnecessarily taking up space. The Z collections and Photograph Z folders are housed in collection number order. The rest of the formats that are housed Z style do not need to be housed in collection number order. 

The principle behind housing Z-style is that you find the next available place for your materials in the run of boxes or drawers. Each box or drawer is numbered and this number is recorded in the location database. There will also be a place for you to record your item numbers, usually on the lid of the box or the front of the drawer, as a double-check. 

Unlike the three-part item number, the box number or drawer number represents the item's physical location and is recorded in the location database, but not recorded in the finding aid. For example, an oversize paper folder may have the item number OPF-2504/3 and be housed in Oversize Box 25. Patrons would request the folder using the number OPF-2504/3. Research and Instruction staff would check the database and see that that particular folder can be found in Box 25.

![Oversize paper and photograph Zs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79476377-e6caca00-7fd6-11ea-8e75-7cb38a038c3d.jpeg "Oversize paper and photographs are housed Z-style, but not necessarily in collection number order")
![Z contents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79476565-25608480-7fd7-11ea-9d25-37e76a7bbc8e.jpeg "The contents of the box are recorded on a label on the box lid")

When are photographs filed as a Z collection?

![5 or less picture folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79477514-4a092c00-7fd8-11ea-8717-4a6db741eebb.jpeg "If you have 5 or fewer picture folders, file them with the Photo z run in collection-number order")
![6 or more picture folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79477725-8d639a80-7fd8-11ea-826e-fa1487652699.jpeg "If you have 6 or more picture folders, place them in a document case(s) or record cartons and file them at the end of your collection. Begin numbering the picture box(es) with 'Image Box 1'")

Oversize papers or photographs is our medium size designation for flat items. This designation is for items that are too large to fit in legal folders but small enough that they do not need to be stored in the very large map and print folders. Oversize papers or photographs can be described as individual items or as groups of items. Regardless, the items live in folders stored in flat, large, grey storage boxes. You may enclose multiple items in each folder, but do not overstuff the folder such that the materials are at risk of injury each time an unwieldy folder is removed from the grey boxes. We house oversize papers and photographs similarly so they are grouped together in our documentation, but do keep in mind that we do NOT mix papers and photographs in the same large grey flat box.  

There are some occasions in which it is not feasible to house the materials in folders, and they can simply live in the large, flat, grey box on their own. In that case, your items will have the designation of "oversize box or (OB-)."

## Labeling individual oversize items

Do your labeling neatly and in pencil in the top right hand corner on the back of the item with OP-0000, where OP is for oversize papers or OP-P-0000 where OP-P is for oversize photographs followed by the collection number. If you are describing your oversize items as a group, you do not need to label each individual oversize item. The label on the folder will suffice.  

## Folder labels


| ![Labeling a folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79478328-44f8ac80-7fd9-11ea-8937-fb963b61c5b3.jpeg "If you have 6 or more picture folders, place them in a document case(s) or record cartons and file them at the end of your collection. Begin numbering the picture box(es) with 'Image Box 1'") | With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

- Label folders for oversize papers (individually described) with OP-0000, where the OP indicates oversize papers and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize papers (described as a group) with OPF-0000, where the OPF indicates oversize paper **folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize photographs (individually described) with OP-P-0000, where the OP-P indicates oversize photographs and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label folders for oversize photographs (described as a group) with OP-PF-0000, where the OP-PF indicates oversize **photograph folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

Number the folders according to how many are in each run (e.g., #1 of 1; #3 of 6). Restricted items should be isolated in their own folders. Stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in red on folders that contain restricted items in a clearly visible place near your other labeling.  

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79479438-c0a72900-7fda-11ea-9ad8-60a2cd29f2db.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing individually described items; note that the '1-3' in OP-5600/1-3 means that this folder contains the individually numbered items, 1-3. The phrase 'Folder 1 of 4' indicates that there are four paper folders in this collection and this is the first of the four")
![Example of oversize folder with items described as a group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79479865-6195e400-7fdb-11ea-858e-1adbd2a91720.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing items described as a group the 'F' in the prefix OPF differentiates these from the individually described items.

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79480048-973acd00-7fdb-11ea-8e03-df2c80008921.jpeg "Example of oversize folder containing individually described items ")

## Housing oversize materials

Instead of separate runs for boxes of oversize folders (OPs), boxes of oversize photographs (OP-Ps), and boxes with other items, such as oversize photo-albums housed in the large flat boxes, these all live together in the same run. Collections are not housed in numerical order in this run; locations are tracked in the location table.  

> Note: There are three sizes of flat, gray boxes. The 16" x 20", 18"x24" (a.k.a. Jackie's Redemption) and the 2' x 3' (a.k.a. Jackie's Folly). We no longer order the 16" x 20" size, but from time to time they appear. All three sizes are represented with same container type (OP, OP-P, OB); in the finding aid, we do not distinguish among the three. The Folly boxes are better for lighter materials since they are difficult to maneuver on and off of the shelves.  

## Oversize papers in folders

| ![Oversize papers in folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79480514-2e078980-7fdc-11ea-925a-7a7f0a10191e.jpeg "The flag indicates that there is room for more folders") |  With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Oversize photographs in folders

| ![Oversize photographs in folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79493101-fc4bee00-7fee-11ea-8e60-d0f895d0fe12.jpeg "The stickers on box 71 and 89 indicate that they are oversize photograph boxes") | As with the oversize papers in folders, we want to fill an oversize photograph box before moving to the next. We put an indicator on the last box of oversize photograph folders. You should fill up that box before a new oversize photograph box is started. Just like with oversize papers, we can intermingle collections of oversize photographs in folders.  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Oversize items not in folders

These should get their own box(es). Loose items from different collections, e.g. posters not in folders, should not be intermingled with items from other collections.  

## Putting folders in boxes

Boxes should only hold six to eight folders. If they have too many folders, it's difficult for Research and Instruction staff to flip through to find the folders they need to retrieve. Record the collection number on the sticker on the box's lid; the box number should also be recorded on the sticker. As a double-check, record the box number on the folder.  

![Sticker on top of box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481145-17adfd80-7fdd-11ea-9805-e4fcbecec005.jpeg "The sticker on the top of the box includes the box number and lists all the collections housed in that box")
![Box number on folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481279-41ffbb00-7fdd-11ea-9341-b3a7c841c031.jpeg "The box number is also recorded on the folder")

## Making a new oversize box

Pre-printed labels for new boxes can be found in the green folder on the supplies table in the TS archival processing room.  

There are sticky labels for recording collection numbers on the lid and "Photographs" labels for boxes with photographs.  

## Extra-oversize papers or photographs (X-OP, X-OP-P-)

![Map cases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79481921-1df0a980-7fde-11ea-835f-6013ca7edd89.jpeg "Map cases")
![Map case drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482049-437db300-7fde-11ea-96be-4258853881de.jpeg "Map case drawer")

The extra-oversize designation refers to our largest papers and photographs. These live in very large folders (typically called map and print folders) in map case drawers. Like oversize papers and photographs, extra-oversize papers or photographs can be described individually or in groups. Note that these materials are quite awkward for our Research and Instruction staff to page, so it is important to describe them thoroughly in the finding aid.  

The extra-oversize designation is a relatively new development in the history of oversize papers at the SHC. In the past, all oversize papers were numbered OP-0000/n, regardless of whether they were housed in the grey boxes or in the map cases. A filing system and a coded list of oversize papers with Series A (map cases) and Series B (grey boxes) assignations steered Research and Instruction staff to the location of the item. This system became increasingly unwieldy and is superseded by the OP/XOP runs.  

## Labeling extra-oversize items

Do your labeling neatly and in pencil in the top right hand corner on the back of the item with XOP-0000, where XOP is for oversize papers or with XOP-P-0000 where XOP-P is for oversize photographs followed by the collection number. As with oversize papers or photographs, if you are describing the the items as a group, you do not have to label each individual item. The folder label will suffice.  

## Labeling extra-oversize folders

| ![Labeling a folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482194-7e7fe680-7fde-11ea-8fc2-6b306311fb0e.jpeg "Labeling a folder") | With the fold at the top of the folder, do your labeling on the bottom right edge so that it is easy to see collection numbers as you flip through the folders in the map cases and flat boxes. |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize papers (individually described) with XOP-0000, where the XOP indicates extra large oversize papers and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize papers (described as a group) with XOPF-0000, where the XOPF indicates extra large oversize paper **folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize photographs (individually described) with XOP-P-0000, where the XOP-P indicates extra large oversize photographs and is followed by the collection number.  

- Label map case folders for extra-oversize photographs (described as a group) with XOP-PF-0000, where the XOP-PF indicates extra large oversize **photograph folder(s)** and is followed by the collection number.  

The collection creator is added under the collection number. Number the folders according to how many are in each run (e.g., #1 of 1; #3 of 6). Restricted items should be isolated in their own folders. Stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in red on folders that contain restricted items in a clearly visible place near your other labeling.  

![Example of oversize folder with individually described items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79482570-036b0000-7fdf-11ea-8253-2a66dfa4ee03.jpeg "An extra-oversize folder containing individually described papers; note that the '1-3' in XOP-5600/1-3 means that this folder contains the individually numbered items, 1-3.

## Separated volumes (SV-)

![Separated volumes](https://github.com/athomp4105/In-Progress/issues/70 "This volume fits into a legal size folder and can be housed in a document case or records center carton. It will NOT be treated as a separated volume")

Any volume that cannot be foldered and housed in document cases or records center cartons is a separated (SV) volume. Separated volumes should be marked clearly with SV-0000/n, where SV (for separated volume) is followed by the collection number and the individual volume number. Some separated volumes have custom boxes, but most are wrapped in alkaline paper and tied with linen tape to keep out dust and reduce abrasion. Separated volumes that likely will be used frequently may sit naked on the shelf because frequent use prevents dust from settling for too long on the volume. Separated volumes that are too large for wrapping or not valuable enough for custom boxes may be housed in a flat box (more than one volume may be housed in one box) or, as a last resort, sit naked on the shelf. Ask your supervising archivist if you are unsure of the best method to house and store your separated volumes.  

## Wrapping separated volumes

Separated volumes should be wrapped with archival paper. Because these volumes will be repeatedly wrapped and unwrapped, tape is not used. Instead, linen tape is used to keep the wrapping together. However, this does not mean that you can practice your boy/girl scout ties. A simple bow will suffice.  

![Weighted item](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79483653-8b9dd500-7fe0-11ea-80cd-35f78a2944d6.jpeg "Just like wrapping a present...maybe without the weights")
![Step 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490073-50080880-7fea-11ea-9a27-eed6db2bfec4.jpeg "The tying process: step 1")
![Step 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490159-7332b800-7fea-11ea-8192-2a4ffa45eab1.jpeg "The tying process: step 2")
![Finished product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490352-b7be5380-7fea-11ea-9bc5-76f55429ffc6.jpeg "The finished product")

Write the volume number on the wrapper so that it is clearly visible when the volume is placed on the shelf (typically on the edge of the package). Also write the volume number on the wrapper covering the top of the volume to reduce confusion when the volume is unwrapped and re-wrapped. For restricted volumes, stamp or write "RESTRICTED" in both places on the wrapper.  

![Wrapped volumes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490442-de7c8a00-7fea-11ea-82a5-c46749ebac5f.jpeg "Wrapped volumes")

**Wrapped volumes are labeled on the side so the label is clearly visible when the volume is placed on the shelf; they are also labeled on the top **

## Unwrapped volumes

| ![Unwrapped volumes on shelves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490609-1f749e80-7feb-11ea-86a9-f37336bc74ca.jpeg "Unwrapped volumes on shelves") | **Some volumes are too large or unwieldy to wrap or box. Generally, these are sturdy enough that they should not face too much harm sitting naked on the shelf. You can pencil the SV number on the inside front cover of the volume, or write the number on strips of acid-free paper tucked into the volume. If you have a restricted volume, write 'RESTRICTED' on the strip of paper, do not write RESTRICTED on the volume itself** |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---:|

## Volumes in boxes

Volumes may need the stability provided by a box. We typically have a supply of clamshell boxes that can be used for this purpose.  

![Clamshell boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79490821-7aa69100-7feb-11ea-971f-d25f86d9a7af.jpeg "10 in x 15 in Clamshell boxes")

![Special boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491015-cce7b200-7feb-11ea-8ea9-1786bad3ede7.jpeg "Occasionally, a volume may warrant a special box made by the Conservation Department")
![University Archives volumes in boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491123-f3a5e880-7feb-11ea-885a-9794b2a7c875.jpeg "University Archives volumes in boxes")

You can pencil the SV number on the inside front cover of the volume, or write the number on strips of acid-free paper tucked into the volume. If you have a restricted volume, write "RESTRICTED" on the strip, do not write RESTRICTED on the volume itself.  

These boxes will live in the same run as the other oversize materials and are treated in the same manner. See Housing Oversize Materials for specifics on housing volumes in flat, gray boxes.  

## Photograph albums (PA-)

Photograph albums are a special type of separated volume and receive item numbers starting with the prefix PA-0000/1. They receive this special designation because we want to be able to identify all photographic materials in case we have the opportunity to move all of our photographs to cold storage. See the Separated Volumes section for information on how to wrap or box photograph albums.  

## Special format photographs (SF-P-)

Special format photographs such as daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes receive item numbers starting with SF-P-0000/1.  

![Special format photographs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491332-4c758100-7fec-11ea-8e6e-0006e491f1ff.jpeg "Special format photographs are placed in an alkaline envelope labeled with the item number; one or two envelopes then go into a small box")

## Audiocassettes (C-)

Cassettes must have cases before they can be housed. Audiocassettes frequently arrive in their own containers and, typically, it is fine to use these.  

Every audiocassette receives an item number starting with C-00000/1.  

![Audiocassette label 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79491633-bf7ef780-7fec-11ea-8c99-072fc45892f7.jpeg "Audiocassettes are labeled on the tape itself...")

## Reel to reel audio tapes (T-)

Audiotapes must have boxes before they can be housed. Audiotapes frequently arrive in their own containers and typically, it is fine to use these.  

Audiotapes receive item numbers starting with T-00000/1, where T (for tape) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual audiotape.  

![Audiotape labeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492042-695e8400-7fed-11ea-9d16-58a05ae90fac.jpeg "Label the spine of the audiotape box but do not label the tape itself")

## Audiodiscs (D-) (a.k.a. records or vinyl)

Audiodiscs should be stored in record jackets. If they have no jackets, place them in alkaline jackets. Audiodiscs receive item numbers starting with D-00000/1, where D (for disc) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual disc.  

![Audiodisc labeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492305-c9552a80-7fed-11ea-8034-0d1dba66b2a9.jpeg "Write the item number in the upper right corner of the jacket")

## Film (F-)

Films receive item numbers starting with F-00000/1, where F (for film) is followed by the collection number and the number of the individual film.  

We decide how to provide housing for film on case-by-case basis. Consult with your supervising archivist on the available options.  

> Note: If a strange and unpleasant odor emanates from the film, you may be dealing with nitrate-based film. If you can detect the unpleasant odor before the canister is opened, **DO NOT OPEN THE CAN**. This film, used between 1915 and 1950, is highly unstable and can be dangerous. If you think that you have nitrate-based film, consult with a supervising archivist immediately.  

## Videotapes (VT-)

Videotapes must be stored in cases. Videotapes typically arrive in their own cases and it is typically fine to use these.  

Label the videotape and videotape case with VT-00000/1, where VT (for videotape) is followed by the collection number and the individual item number.  

You may have to create labels for the tape and the case.  

![Videotape labeling 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492651-47b1cc80-7fee-11ea-8ad8-7bc19a6b7690.jpeg "The item number isrecorded on the tape itself...")

## Rolled items (R-)

| ![Rolled items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79492911-b4c56200-7fee-11ea-9d29-6357a37d6226.jpeg "Rolled items") | Rolled items should be marked clearly, starting with R-0000/1, where R (for rolled item) is followed by the collection number and the individual item number. Several drawers at the end of the extra-oversize papers in the map cases have been reserved for items that cannot or should not be unrolled. Consult with you supervising archivist about whether or not to unroll a questionable item |
