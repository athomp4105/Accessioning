# Labels

_Updated July 2019_

### Box labels include: 

- "One Library" heading with UNC-CH logo 

- Record group/collection number 

- Record group/collection name 

- Folder numbers (if used) 

- Box number 

- Once shelved, hand-write shelf coordinates in bottom-left corner (Example: Red U10b3) 

The current box label template can be found on the G drive at G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary newtemp.  You can overwrite the existing labels so your labels will have the correct information about the collection you're working on.  I don't tend to save changes I make to the labels template, but you can if you want.  Just be aware other people use the template, too, so it might not be the same next time you open it. 

If you need to make more pages of labels in the template, you can copy all the cells on a page, right-click at the bottom of the page, and click "Keep Original Table Formatting" under "Paste Options" in the menu that comes up. 

**Technical alert:** if your copy selection includes the return at the bottom of the page, the closest choice to what you want will be "Keep Source Formatting" and there will be an extra return at the bottom of your new page, which you should delete so it doesn't misalign the page.  I find the formatting symbols tool (the paragraph symbol button on the home ribbon or ctrl+shift+8) incredibly helpful, because it makes all the invisible parts of the document (returns, tabs, spaces, etc) visible and demystifies certain word processor behaviors/formatting problems (but let's face it, not all of them can be demystified).  And don't worry, the symbols won't show up on printed labels. 

The physical labels this template is meant for are foil-backed labels from University Products.  They come in shrink-wrapped packs with pieces of cardboard in the front and back of the stack of labels.  The sheets themselves are unmarked, but there is a sticker on the pack that says "FOILBACK LASER LABELS 6LBL/SH" "SIZE 3"X4"".  If you're still not sure, ask someone if you've got the right ones. 

**Example (Paige box)**

**Example (Hollinger)**
![Example on a Hollinger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390068-07dedc80-7f3d-11ea-92d2-a87be95b4109.jpeg "Example on a Hollinger")
This example also includes the shelf coordinates in the bottom-left corner of the label. 

If we run out of foil-backed labels, we use packing labels similar to Avery 5164s.  Should you need to use those, the template for those can be found on the G drive at G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary 5164 temp.  It's important to use the correct template because the foil-back labels are different dimensions from the 5164s. 

If you have a box of restricted material, stamp the label "CLOSED" in red and attach an orange "CLOSED. DO NOT PAGE" tag with a binder clip.  You can find these tags in the folder that holds the oversize, z box, and audiocassette labels.  If you need to print more, you can find the template for these in the labels folder on the G drive.  (G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Closed Do Not Page Tags)  Orange paper can currently be found in the metal supply cabinet near the 4th floor research room and photocopier.

Other formats require some or all of the above information. 

Other formats also come in different sized/shaped boxes that do not have enough room for a whole box label.  In cases such as this, it is okay to "condense" the label in the template (I usually do this simply by deleting returns), and then trim the label.  My preferred label-trimming method is using an Xacto knife and a straight edge, as illustrated below: 

Before the cut, lining up the ruler:

### The following are some examples of labels on other formats. 

#### Oversize volume (SV-collection number/item number) 

On the box.  We like to do two sides, one on the short side and one on the long side, so the volume can be identified from multiple angles and give us more flexibility when shelving. 

Short side:
![Short side](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79390727-40cb8100-7f3e-11ea-8a94-9142cef7d9c6.jpeg "Short side")

Long side:
![Long side](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79391680-f9de8b00-7f3f-11ea-9578-797f75b20c16.jpeg "Long side")

Please note that these are "condensed" labels as discussed above.

#### Wrapped volume

Here is a wrapped volume (doesn't need a label, just needs unique ID written on it as described in the Physical Processing section). 

![Wrapped volume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392102-cb14e480-7f40-11ea-9451-e10f9f268100.jpeg "Wrapped volume")

#### Oversized papers, oversize paper folders (see Physical Processing section for more details) 

(OPF-collection number/folder number-) oversize paper folder, items not individually numbered 

Goes in shared boxes, labeled like so:
![Shared boxes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392231-0c0cf900-7f41-11ea-8e35-56f4d80c9d1c.jpeg "Shared boxes")

Example of an oversize folder (OPF):
![OPF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392292-2e067b80-7f41-11ea-8771-ac0afd5e2382.jpeg "OPF")
More details about this in the Physical Processing section.

(XOPF-collection number/folder number) map case folder size, items not individually numbered 

![XOPF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392433-60b07400-7f41-11ea-92cd-eee0f67d32a3.jpeg "XOPF")

Let's zoom in a little on the same folder:

And here is the label on the mapcase drawer:
![Mapcase drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392611-a3724c00-7f41-11ea-8eae-1ca2f471392e.jpeg "Mapcase drawer")

(OP-collection number/item number) oversize paper, individually numbered 
[**IMAGE**] 

(XOP-collection number/item number) map case size, individually numbered 
[**IMAGE**] 

We don't regularly do individually numbered OPs and XOPs anymore.  It is similar to OPFs and XOPFs.  You write the X/OP number on the back of each X/OP, and you write the range of X/OPs in the X/OPF in the lower right corner of the folder.  Depending on the collection, you might also include the X/OPF number.  Please refer to the "Items Separated" section, which was written in the era of X/OPs, and feel free to ask questions. 

#### Audiocassette

Audiocassette (C-collection number/item number) 

On the item and its container. 
![Audiocassette](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392790-f6e49a00-7f41-11ea-92b5-563a4cf09e4f.png "Audiocassette")

On the item and/or its container. 
![Audiotape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58087302/79392873-18de1c80-7f42-11ea-8267-140a73ffbc61.png "Audiotape")
