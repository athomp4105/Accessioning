# 2 Integrated Additions (folder)

Occasionally it makes sense to integrate a folder into the original deposit rather than to create a new series. Unlike drop-ins, this addition likely will be filed physically at the end of the collection but will be listed with the original deposit where it fits intellectually.  This does not mean that we have stopped caring about provenance! Write "Addition of ___" and the accession number on the folder.  

In the finding aid, add an < acqinfo > statement at the container level: 

< acqinfo >< p >Acquisitions Information:  Accession 109832</ p ></ acqinfo > 

And at the series level: 

< acqinfo >< p >Acquisitions Information:  F-20025/934 received as Addition of October 2016 (Acc. 102664).</ p ></ acqinfo >
