# Drop-ins (items)

Occasionally it makes sense to drop a single item or two in with the original deposit. This does not mean that we have stopped caring about provenance! Enclose your item in a piece of archival paper and write the accession number on outside before dropping into an existing folder. In the finding aid, add an < acqinfo > statement at the container level: 

< acqinfo >< p >Acquisitions Information: Letter, 10 April 1865, was received as Accession 109832</ p ></ acqinfo > 

> Note: drop-ins are not an option for collections/containers that have been microfilmed or digitized.
