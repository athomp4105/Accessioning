# Minimal Processing Pre-intake

#### We need to know: 

Photographic materials, by their very nature, CAN be some of the most unique and highly useful research materials in our collections; however, they often require a level of preservation and description (especially if potential digitization is in the future)  that can be costly in both time and supplies. 
 
The return can be high,  but due to our limited resources for processing photographic materials, this effort needs to be spent on the most at-risk and/or unique photographic materials in our holdings. 
 
I like to think of any new coll. as a new  "Collector's  / Creator's Archive" 
 
Like Wilson Special Collections they create (or collect) materials that we can consider "primary research images."  
 
(Much like the research and publications generated from our holdings, exhibits, presentations, finding aids, etc...) 
 
These "primary research images" can include original images created  by donor (or original creator/group/company) or "contracted" by donor. They can also collect or acquire original photographic materials that they did not create, but now own (either legally or just possession) 

UNC usually ends up "owning" them.....they are out of copyright, OR the grouping of materials they have been collected are original and/or unique.  

#### Usually where the unique stuff is.

Like Wilson Special Collections, they also create (or collect) images we can consider "secondary research images."  

**They may create (or collect)** "secondary research images"  either in the operation of their business/group and/or doing research/publishing.  These images can include materials collected while doing research or running business/group that may provide clues to how a project was put together or how a business/group operated...but they are not themselves unique and can really ONLY be used as reference. These materials are usually owned/copyrighted by an external group/person and are not conveyed in deed of gift for collection they are in) 
 
(Like our listening copies, scans, digitized materials, most of our books, mass-produced commercial recordings, mass-produced commercial photography, etc...) 

#### Using this "matrix" here are some examples from Irwin (20551) 
 
## "Rounder Records Photographs"
 
**Images depicting operation, staff, and artists associated with Rounder.**

Includes "primary research images" created by or for Irwin and/or Rounder Records, related to Rounder: 
 
- Negatives depicting studio 
- Slides of studio and artists in studio 
- Headshots of artists who worked with Rounder  
- (Can we get negatives? Photographers listed. Rounder should/may own the negatives from the shoot) 
- Owners and staff portraits 
 
Images are unique and rights should be transferred with deed of gift. 

This is where time should be spent 
 
"Rounder Reference Photographs" 
 
- The Non-Rounder--Record publicity headshots.   
- Appear to be people who were already famous and or signed to a label. Almost all of them have a Copyright stamp and are "modern." 
- Interesting to somebody who can see he may have wanted Jerry to record or play banjo uncredited,  but that image is copyrighted and famous.  You could google it now and  get it on phone. 
 
Images are not unique and we do not have copyright  

We would spend no time on them 

## "The Ken Irwin Photographs"

Portrait of Irwin 

Images of Irwin and others  (Where he is the main subject of the images) 

- Images of Irwin's family  
- Personalized/autographed headshots from artists to Irwin 

We would spend time on these 

## "Hazel Dickens Photographs"

Images collected by Irwin of Hazel Dickens, who was also a friend, and of the Dickens family. These include both "primary resources" .. but even the secondary sources are unique due to their friendship. Also primary materials created and including Irwin. 
 
Images are unique and we have copyright over some and or all (we may actually have originals and hold copyright of many of the "familiar" prints of Ms. Dickens)
