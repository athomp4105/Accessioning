| Intake                        | Collection Level                                                                                | Collection level record AT/MARC/EAD                                                                                                                                                                                                     | As-is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Transfer into archival quality RC boxes. Mark any boxes with photographic materials (...other than a few prints sprinkled in correspondence) that will need separate storage OR restrictions to access/use.                                                                   |
| First-Pass                    | Series/Subseries/Box Level                                                                      | Brief finding aid with series/subseries level-descriptions and/or box- level descriptions (if more than one box).                                                                                                                       | Put series/boxes in rough order                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Folder/house loose items (where you  find them). Replace folders, binders, or other enclosures ONLY if un-serviceable. If there are multiple formats in box that are mixed up; separate film-based media (negatives, slides, etc..) for eventual storage with 'like-formats.' | 
| Moderate Second Pass          | Folder Level (Using “file level” container in EAD with at least IB-/# MAYBE PF-/# level spans.) | Finding aid enhanced with folder lists or simple inventories. Existing inventories repurposed (after review). May enhance “items” with ball-park image counts and still using broad “Photographic Prints, Photographic Negatives” terms | Materials should be put in “page-able chunks,” (IB-##### or PF-#####) preserving original order (when usable). Perform rough sort of any loose materials. Note any “relationship” between prints and negatives in BROAD terms (the negatives in PF-#####/# may be in folder PF-#####/# for images. | Use folders and labels (or other enclosures) when in good shape. House batches of physically similar materials (may be subdivided subjects, formats, dates, etc..)  in reasonable 'chunks.' Only individually call out significant 'items.'                                   |
| Moderate (Old School)         | Folder Level (Using single PF-/# containers for each enclosure)                                 | Finding aid includes detailed folder listings with a container listing for each folder in box. Folder titles are standardized and refined. Specific formats are called out and are included in ```<genreform>``` tags                   | Put folders in order. Sort loose items into any groups that may become evident. Organize any materials that appear to be 'related' (Negatives, prints,  copies, etc…). Folders may be numbered.                                                                                                    | Efforts should  be rehoused. Film formats should rehoused and stored according to best practice                                                                                                                                                                               |

## (Proposed) Levels of Preservation

| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intake     | Collection Level     | Material boxed and reviewed for presence of film formats. Anything that needs to be isolated immediately due to preservation needs.                                                                                                                                                 |
| First-Pass | Series/Subseries/Box | All film based media separated for appropriate storage. Rolled photographs and other material that can not be used without high risk of damage should be isolated and/or restricted. Basic steps taken to maintain associations between identifying annotations and related images. |
| Moderate   | Folder Level         | Finding aid with abbreviated folder lists or simple inventories. Existing description repurposed. Note material stored separately due to media or format type at a more granular level.                                                                                             |
