# SHC-Z Images

This document is intended for use when a new collection or addition to existing collection has a "Zs worth" of photographic materials.  Additionally, this document is also intended to convey "what is going on" in some of our "legacy collections" that have had photographic materials processed and handled for obsolete reproduction workflows and best-practices.  

## Current state of SHC-Z "Image Boxes" 

#### Prints (up to 8x10 ..upright in document cases P-#####, PF-#####)  

- Majority of materials are photographic prints  
- There are some other formats present 
- There are some large amount of photographic materials that could be removed 

#### Oversize Prints (In 11x14 and larger flat boxes ... O-P-####) 

#### Extra Oversize Prints (In Map Case Drawers … XO-P/#####) 

#### Special Format Boxes (cased images, stereo-cards, glass negatives) 

#### Negatives (N-###) not described anywhere (about 90% done with updating finding aids for negatives uncovered about a year ago) 

A few years back, I realized that the "corresponding" negatives for SHC-Z Images had been removed, and rehoused they were not described in finding aid or LDB. IN order to help make the materials that have already been described and rehoused, as well as handle formats being added to SHC Z-Image Boxes) 

I have added the following boxes to the SHC Z Image Boxes 

- Z Image Boxes 1-127: MOSTLY photographic prints 
- Z Image Box 128: Medium format film (5x7) 
- Z Image Box 129: Large format film (8x10) 
- Z Image Box 130:  Smaller format film (4x5 and smaller) 
- Z Image Box 131: Oversized format film (+8x10) 
- Z Image Box 132:  Mixed formats (unsorted) 
- Z Image Box 133: 35mm/120 Roll Film (b&w) 
- Z Image Box 134: 35mm/120 Roll Film (color) 
- Z Image Box 135: Special Formats (cased images/direct print formats) 
- Z Image Box 136: Mounted slides 
- Z Image Box 137: Glass plate negatives

Idea is that materials can be put here, where there is a small groups of photographic materials, but due to specialized formats, they should be separated if: 

- Formats pose a risk to one another 
- Materials have been included in a digitization request 

## Photographic Materials Found in SHC manuscript materials 

single/ a few folders of photographic materials that were pulled from manuscript in materials.   

These folders are numbered Sequentially using P-, PF-, N- numbering 

These boxes can, historically speaking, contain a variety of photographic formats:, negatives, prints, special formats, etc… 

**All of my suggestions are intended to modify this practice, BUT:** 

- Standardize practices for TS to be applied to all (analog) photographic materials 

- Make it easier to find this stuff (R&I) 

- Make sure the materials themselves are stored properly so they are around for the long haul 

## General Principles

To be good stewards of materials, we should 

Keep CONTEXT of materials by keeping images created/collected together 

This can mean keeping a roll of film, stack of negatives, stack of photos of same event/subject; or images that are derivatives of one another (negative and print), that arrive together...by proximity or in same enclosure. 

**We ideally separate film formats:**

- Negatives by “backer” make up (nitrate, acetate, glass, polyester)  

- Negatives by “size” 

- Negatives by color / b&w 

We ideally separate prints from negatives and some prints with prints  

(priority on original/unique negatives) 

### Contact sheets and negatives / Prints and negatives 

Contact sheets and prints can serve as surrogates for the negatives and help preserve origianl negatives, which are irreplaceable. 

If we are talking about smallish pockets of stuff that will, because of how the materials were used and stored by a majority of the donors we have seen over the years, already be together and in “predictable” formats, enclosures,, and storage situations. 

I feel as if we can do this, even in a light way. 
 
I would keep the existing "Z-Image" system that has been in place for many years, with a few modifications.  

I propose keep the SHC-Z-Photograph box method. ..keep the box sequence ..BUT from now on, designate boxes for specific formats.  

(See above for suggested best practice divisions) 

Like we did for 20484 (Barnard)  

## Film Storage (New)

- Z Image Box: Medium size b&w sheet film (5x7) 

- Z Image Box: Large size b&w sheet film (8x10) 

- Z Image Box: Small size b&w sheet film (4x5) 

- Z image Box: 35mm & 120 b&w roll film 

- Z image Box: 35mm & 120 color roll film 

- Z Image Box: 35mm slides (b&w/color) 

- Z Image Box: Special Formats (Tintypes, Ambrotypes, et..) 

- Z Image Box: Glass Plates 

- Z Image Box: Mixed negatives (unsorted negatives) 

- Z Image Box: Photographic prints larger than 8x10 that re stored FLAT 

- Current plan is to continue using the O-PF and X-O-PF system in place. 

- (Not Implemented yet)  

- Z Image Box: BIG Oversized Box for larger tan 11x14 Prints 

What Should I include in the finding aid, if adding this type of material to these boxes 

**Container type Box:** Z-Photo Box ## 

**Container type Enclosure:** PF-Coll#/# 

**Title (From enclosure, description, or create general description)** 

**Extent (number of whatever format you are describing)** 

**Genre/Format ( Can just say photographic prints and/or negatives)**
