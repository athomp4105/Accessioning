# Intro: Minimal Processing of Photographic Materials

These new guidelines are intended to provide accelerated access to materials so that they may be used as soon as possible after acquisition and also to provide a basis for descriptions  and preservation status that can be iterative.  For a majority of the photographic materials acquired, this may NOT be the last time we handle these materials or add description, rather it is a time when we can access what can be used now, what should be done to keep the materials safe in the immediate future (used in reading room), and what steps may need to be taken to provide enhanced description and long-term preservation/storage. 

Photographic materials, by their very nature, CAN be some of the most unique and highly useful research materials in our collections; however, they often require a level of preservation and description (especially if potential digitization is in the future)  that can be costly in both time and supplies. 
 
The return can be high, but due to our limited resources for processing photographic materials, this effort needs to be spent on the most at-risk and/or unique photographic materials in our holdings. 

In order to make this process run effectively, it is important that information is collected BEFORE the materials come to Wilson Library. 

The following are important factors in being able to use photographic materials:

- Quality of Appraisal 

- Any copyright/use Restrictions 

- Institutional Resources 

- Physical Condition 

- Physical Order 

- Physical Access (analog) 

- Digital access (analog and digital)
