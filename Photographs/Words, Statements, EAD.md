# Words, Statements, EAD

Photographs not photos. 

Titles in quotation marks are derived from original containers. 

Notes and frame-level descriptions on the original enclosures and on the verso of the proof sheets have been included when present. 

Folder titles were derived from original folder names and from descriptive metadata found within the files by the processing archivist. Images were sorted into categories, such as Awards, Buildings, Campus Events, and Commencement, created at the repository during processing based on the existing directory structure. 

Loose images were sorted into family and church groupings at the repository during processing.  

Albums are in original order as received at the repository but descriptive information has been added by the processing archivist.  

> NOTE (As of 01/01/18):  Unless you are dealing with an "oversized image" (print, negative, or other formats...larger than 11"x14") or a Special Format Image (Glass Plate Negatives, "Cased Images" (Ambrotypes, Daguerreotypes, Tintypes); Photographic materials should all use the Image Box (IB-collection#/box# ) / Image Folder (PF-collection#/box#) container types. Use ```<physdesc><genreform>FORMAT</physdesc></genreform>``` in container to convey format type. (See "Photographs" section of Wilson Tech Services Notebook)
