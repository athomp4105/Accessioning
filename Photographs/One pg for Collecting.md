# One Page For Collecting

What does TS need to know about photographic materials in collection… 

> Donor= creator, collector, organization, etc...

## The Materials:

- Is the donor the creator of the bulk of the images/photographic materials? * 

- Does the transfer of materials include transfer of copyright? ** 

- Are there materials that are collected  (copied)? 

- When were the images in the collection created/collected? * * * 

- Are the materials (subjects/formats) unique... Do you know of any similar collections? 

- Do the materials depict  populations, communities, or subjects that have historically been under represented in Wilson Special Collections?  

- Is the collection mostly prints? (Are there existing "user-copies" for negatives or digital files) 

- Are there negatives or other non-print photographic formats (see format listing)? 

- Are there digital files? 

- Is there an index, listing, sticky notes, paper clipped notes, and if so, who created them (and why) ? 

- Have the photographic materials been published (by the donor or others)? 

- Were the materials “in active use” by donor or researchers before transfer? 

- Does the collection smell like vinegar (or anything else unpleasant)? 

- Do you need to consult a format specialist before taking this in? (Facetime, teams chat with images, text,etc..)  

- Are we the best repository for this collection? 

## Research:

- Are the images themselves the primary resource or is a secondary (reference collection)? 

- Can the materials be used “as-is”? 

- Are there people who could assist in further description if materials were digitized? 

- Does the donor expect digitization of photographic materials as a condition of donation? 

- How do you envision researchers using the images (and not violating copyright or getting us in trouble)? 

- Does the collection have materials elsewhere? 

> Notes for above:

> **, *Archival collections often contain photographic materials amassed for publication or research. Typically, this type of use agreements are for one-time use and would not be transferable to a collecting institution. Is important to note which materials are created by the donor and which were collected or contracted for limited use.  These can still be used for research but will not receive the same levels of treatment as other original materials would.

> ***Dates help indicate what formats might be present in the collection that may require rehousing as well as give an idea of general copyright status (for 20th century materials) 
>
> (If images are “collected” or created by another entity…circa dates for that original material)
