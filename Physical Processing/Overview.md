## Physical Processing: Making Collections Usable

Amy Morgan, archival processing assistant 

Before I do any work on a collection, I confer with the archivist in charge of that collection.  They tell me how in depth the collection needs to be handled.  This is important, because not all collections need the same level of work.  For example, if a collection is already in folders that are in good shape, re-foldering may not be necessary.  If there is foldering to be done, some collections need the folders to be completely labeled, while others only require collection name/number, and still others are fine with blank folders.  I also make sure to ask the archivist any questions I have along the way, and inform them of anything strange or possibly noteworthy.  It is always wise to ask about something you are unsure about, and they appreciate you being conscientious and thoughtful about your work. 

> Note: If you yourself are the archivist in charge, I hope this guide is useful to you, too.

My other all-encompassing note is: **ALWAYS USE PENCIL**.  And I mean that; I donâ€™t even have a pen at my desk. 

Here is a list of tasks I often find myself doing to generally make collections reading room ready, not all for the same collection. 

### Paper:

- Determine whether re/foldering is needed at all 
- Determine whether letter- or legal-sized folders are needed 
- Folder loose papers 
- Remove at least some binder clips if there is an obnoxious number of them (saves space) 
- De-binder if necessary and folder up contents 
- Split up overstuffed folders 
- Label folders with collection number and collection name 
- Title folders 
- Number folders 
- Inventory (box list or folder list) 
- House materials in Hollinger or Paige boxes 
- Label the boxes 
- Shelve materials, write coordinates on box labels 
- Send coordinates via ticket to person in charge of the Locations Database for entering 

### AV:

- Inventory 
- Give caseless items cases and replace badly broken cases 
- Label cases with a unique identifier 
- Label A/V items themselves with unique ID if possible/necessary 
- Put items in a shared box 
- Put items in a box dedicated to collection (less frequently) 
- Shelve materials, write item numbers on shared boxes, make note of coordinates 
- Enter coordinates in the non-circulating spreadsheet 

### Photographs:

- Remove from plastic as much as possible 
- Sort by format 
- Sort by subject 
- Sort by size 
- Place images in appropriately-sized acid-free enclosures 
- Estimate circa date and number of images in each enclosure 
- Inventory 
- Number enclosures 
- Shelve materials, write coordinates on boxes 
- Send coordinates via ticket to person in charge of the Locations Database for entering 

### Oversize Papers:

- Determine which size is most appropriate 
- Number individual papers if necessary (usually not necessary) 
- Number the oversize folders and write collection number/ name beneath 
- Place in shared oversize box, write OPF numbers on box, note coordinates 
- Less frequently, place in oversize box dedicated to collection 
- Send coordinates via ticket to person in charge of the Locations Database for entering
