## Foldering loose papers

When foldering loose papers, the best practice is to fold along the score of the folder that best fits the pile of papers within.  What that means is, the papers are flush with each side of the folder, with little to no space left inside the folder.  This helps the papers sit better in the folder and boxes with minimal slumping and curling.  It is helpful to remember that these papers will be sitting this way for decades, and if they are kept flat, they will be easier to work with than if they become semi-permanently curled. 

> Note: if you are reusing folders that already had writing on them from a different collection, make sure you cross out or erase all old, residual information, even if you have turned the folder inside out.  You might be surprised how quickly it can become confusing to have, say, two different collection numbers or titles on a folder. 

Some collections arrive in a big jumble with no folders at all, or some folders and other loose papers packed in a box.  You will likely see papers of many sizes, ranging from letters in envelopes to posters.  That said, what if you find loose papers that are too big for letter- or legal-sized folders?  First, assess what it is, how big it is, the material it’s made of, its importance, etc.  It’s possible you’ll be able to fold it or trim it down to fit (trim pretty much only if it’s slightly too big).  Your archivist in charge will be happy to help you if you feel uncomfortable making the judgment call.  Sometimes, curatorial staff are called in to help make the judgment.  In general, modern computer paper can be folded, but older and/or more delicate material maybe shouldn’t. 

So if you’ve found yourself with paper that must go into an oversize paper folder, depending on the collection you’re working on, you can either add it to an existing OPF or make a new one.  Please see the oversize papers section of this document for more details. 

Okay, so what about those letters in envelopes I mentioned before?  We are steering towards leaving them in the envelopes more often than removing them.  We simply place them in folders like we do for standard sized paper.  If you are asked to remove letters from envelopes, what you do is you put the envelope behind the letter, so the folder contents are: letter, its envelope, letter, its envelope, etc, and keep that consistent, so they can more easily be matched up later.  We keep the envelopes because they typically have lots of useful information on them, such as the names and locations of the correspondents and the postmark with the date.  Even postage stamps can hold valuable information. 

## Splitting up overstuffed folders

Sometimes, existing folders are way too full of papers to handle easily.  In cases such as these, it is necessary to split up the folder into two, three, or sometimes more parts.  Each new folder will have the same title as the original folder, plus (1 of 4), (2 of 4), etc. following the title.  Or if the original folder was untitled, you may leave the title blank, but still write (1 of 4), (2 of 4), etc.  These numbers indicate that this group of folders belongs together and is one intellectual grouping. 

### Helpful tip: 

If a folder is slightly overstuffed, you can create a new score on the folder that creates a wider bottom for the papers to sit in.  This saves you a folder in addition to the time making a new one.  The easiest way to create a new score is with a bone folder and a straight edge, but in a pinch, you can fold it without tools; the edge of your desk may come in handy in trying to get a clean fold.  However, I recommend the bone folder method. 

## Labeling folders

Wilson Special Collections' format for labeling folders is: 

Collection # in the top left corner of the folder with a period at the end.  Then, the collection name in the top middle of the folder.  If you must include the accession number, put it in parentheses next to the title.  Folder numbers go in the top right corner of the folder.  So the whole thing looks like this: 

|                        |              |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| XXXXX. Collection Name | Folder title |
| (Acc. ######)          | ##           |

When handwriting on folders, always use pencil – just like everywhere else in the archives.  For smaller collections, handwriting the collection number and name is usually sufficient.  However, it is more efficient to create a stamp for larger collections. 

It is best to follow the style guide for typed folder lists that will wind up in the finding aid.  However, you may write a truncated version of a long title on the physical folder – it takes less time to write, saves space on the folder, and saves your hand if you're writing on a large number of folders.  Examples of reasonable abbreviations are: using the initials of a name if that person is one of the main players in the collection, state abbreviations (NC for North Carolina), and writing the first few words of a long title of a writing and using an ellipsis at the end.  As long as the researcher can match up the physical folder with the title listed in the finding aid, that is enough.

Only use the lesser-quality labels if we run out of foil-backed, or if archivist-in-charge says otherwise. If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask. 

## Old folders: Reuse or recycle?

If you are replacing old folders, you will need to get rid of them eventually to keep your workspace available for your current project.  But where should they go?  To the reusable folder box or recycle bin? 

### Recycle if:

- Tabbed 
- Beat up (ripped, chunks missing, networks of irregular creases, etc) 
- Soiled, stained, or otherwise gross 
- Heavily written on both sides* 
- Stamped on both sides 

### Reuse if:

- Straight-cut (untabbed/whole "bar" going across top of folder) 
- Lightly used 
- One side blank or lightly written on 

*If the writing on the folder is obviously related to the collection, or – better – the contents of the folder, you can keep the old folder with its contents.  Remove the contents, place the old folder behind them, and put them all in the new folder.  That way, you can keep the creator’s original and maybe helpful notes for the researcher to see. 

## Hanging folders

Hanging folders are worth a mention here.  While they make sense for filing cabinets, they can be a problem for us because they don’t sit very well in paige or hollinger boxes; those hooks are at best annoying, at worst insufferable.  In the past, we have gotten rid of all hanging folders in collections.  Lately, under our relatively new iterative processing practices, we have kept some very large collections in their original hanging folders, because refoldering would have been a monumental task.  Usually, the archivist-in-charge tells me from the start if I should replace or leave hanging folders.  That said, don’t be afraid to ask about them if you come across a pocket of them you weren’t expecting to see. 

## De-bindering and desleeving

This step is not always necessary.  The archivist in charge of the collection usually makes this call, and if there is any doubt, ask. 

De-bindering often saves space inside a box, and sometimes the binder is so big that it doesn’t comfortably fit in a Hollinger, so in cases like that, it’s often better to de-binder.  However, other times, it’s better to leave contents in the binder, even if the binder is too big for a Hollinger.  Examples of when you might leave a binder as-is are if the presentation of the binder/artifactual value are important, or at the other end of the spectrum, it’s simply not worth spending the time de-bindering. 

Desleeving refers to removing papers from plastic sheet protectors.  While it does save space to get rid of the sheet protectors, it is time-consuming, especially for a large quantity of pages, so make sure it’s worth doing for the collection you’re working on. 

> Real-life anecdote:  I did a small collection recently where fragile 19th-century documents were in plastic sheet protectors such that one had to remove them to look at them – some were folded, others were in there with copies or transcripts, which blocked the view from one side.  It would have been risky to serve them up in the reading room, because a researcher would have to take them out to see them and then put them back, and not only were they pretty delicate, it was also a little difficult.  Not a good mix.  In this case, it was in our best interests to spend the time desleeving and foldering/interleaving. 

## House materials in boxes

When housing folders of materials in boxes, it is important to fill the boxes to the right amount of tightness.  This is another way to prevent slumping.  It's also kind of nice when paging the boxes if the materials don't keep shifting and sliding around; it's just easier to handle when the center of gravity remains consistent.  When filling a box, keep putting folders in until the folders no longer visibly slant or slump.  To test tightness, lift a folder halfway, and then let go of it.  If it slides easily back down and hits the bottom of the box with just a little resistance from its neighboring folders, that is good.  The folders will support each other, and researchers can remove folders easily, both of which are safe for the materials.  If it is difficult to pull a folder out, remove a folder or two.  Remember, researchers in the reading room will be using this, and not everyone is as gentle as you are (there's a reason you've gravitated towards Technical Services, after all). 

Sometimes, it is necessary to use a spacer, or a follower block, if you can only partially fill a box.  This is a long piece of archival-quality cardboard which is scored symmetrically on either end.  To put the spacer in the box, fold along the scores that will best fill the space between the last of the materials and the back wall of the box.  Place the spacer with the flat side touching the materials and the ends touching the back of the box.  The same tightness rules apply.  Occasionally, you might find that using two spacers, one on either side of the materials, is the best fit.  One advantage to this is the weight is more centered in the box, but keep in mind balancing the use of resources vs the needs of the materials.
