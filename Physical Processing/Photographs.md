# Photographs

Photographs get complicated.  There are dozens of formats and sizes, and on top of that, some of the formats harm each other if stored together.  Never be afraid to ask for help with photographic materials.  Don't try to wing it if you're not sure.  Pretty much everyone asks Patrick for help, or at the very least, input, on how to handle photographic materials. 

Remove as much plastic packaging, protectors, etc. as possible.  The chemicals used in the photographs can and will react with plastic in unpredictable ways.  It's too bad there isn't transparent paper, but until there is, we're going to have to just deal with opaque, because acid-free paper provides a much more stable environment for the images than plastic. 

Remove as much acidic paper/cardboard as possible, as well.  Newspaper is one example.  One sign it should be removed is if there are browned/yellowed marks where the acidic item was in contact with the other materials.  I recommend removing cardboard/newspaper even if there is no obvious yellowing.  Often, cardboard was placed with a print to keep it from getting bent, but it can cause harm if left in contact with it long-term, so it really is best to remove it at this point.  If there is information related to the collection written/typed on the acidic paper/cardboard, make a copy on acid-free paper and put that in with the material. 

## Circa Dates

You might feel out of your depth with dating images at first – I know I did - but hang in there.  Circa dates are very helpful for researchers.  We usually try to offer a decade estimate, for example 1870s, 1930s, 2010s, etc.  Even if you're a decade or two off, this still gives the researcher a ballpark to work in.  They will have an idea going in whether a group of photos is roughly from the turn of the century or mid-century, for example.  I find that looking at the clothing/fashions in the pictures is a good start.  If there are any cars or equipment/tech in the pictures, that is a big help, too.  The physical format of the image itself can also be a clue.  You get a feel for it after a while.  What helps is when a photograph is labeled as X date, because that gives you a frame of reference.  Also, if you happen to be looking at a collection of family photos, you often see an individual from babyhood to old age, and if you're armed with their birth year, or a year written on the back, you can make pretty good guesses as to what decade an image of that person was taken in.  All of this helps you build your expertise.  It’s very “learn-as-you-go". 

## Housing

Photographic materials are housed in what we call image folders.  The prefix is PF.  Here is an example: if I had image folder 3 in collection #09876, the folder number would be PF-09876/3.  The writing on PFs follows the same guidelines as on paper folders, but with the special number.  Sometimes, the numbering system can be more complex and specify which image box it belongs in.  This is in anticipation of digitization, and helps us keep track of which folders have been digitized, and which images belong where.  The archivist in charge will tell you if that level of numbering is necessary for the collection you’re working on, and I promise you it would make more sense when you’re actually doing it than if I tried to explain it here. 

It is good practice to place photographs in enclosures that are close to their size so they don’t slide around as much as they would in a standard letter- or legal folder.  This reduces the chances of the emulsion getting scratched.  It kind of depends on the collection what kind of box to put the photographs in.  Sometimes, we put the smaller enclosures in letter- or legal-sized folders and place those in Hollingers.  Other times, we put the enclosures in boxes that are sized for them.  One thing I know for certain is that photographic materials 11x14 inches or larger are stored flat, while everything else can be stored vertically.  [Is 11x14 classed as “PF” or OP-PF"?  Where is the cut-off?  Is there a cut-off?] 

If you’re looking for guidance on oversize photographs, please see the next section where I explain about both X/OPFs and X/OP-PFs. 

### Slides

Slides often come to us in plastic holding pages.  Depending on the collection, we will either leave them in there or remove them and place them in little archival-quality paper cartons (I like to call them take-out containers), which then go into special slide boxes.  From a preservation perspective, getting them out of the plastic is vastly preferred, but we don’t always have the time to do that.  Slides that come to us in boxes will almost certainly end up in the archival boxes so they don’t get lost or slide all over the place. 

### Glass formats

There are some glass formats that are very fragile, such as glass-plate negatives and daguerreotypes.  There are special boxes that have "cells", which give the items more support inside the box.  Patrick will tell you more when you ask him about housing those special formats. 

### Daguerreotypes

A note about daguerreotypes and other similar formats:  these images are made up of multiple layers.  Because of this, it is best to leave these images in their frames, which hold them together.  It can really mess up the image if the layers slide around and become misaligned. 

I talk a little about Z image boxes in the Z collections section. 

# Photograph Albums

Often, photograph albums in our collections are best left intact.  If the album is small enough to fit in a hollinger, it can be placed there.  If it's too big for that, it can be placed in a flat box and stored with the photograph collections.
