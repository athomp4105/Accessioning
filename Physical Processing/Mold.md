# In Case of Mold

**Okay, great, but what about mold?**

I’m so glad you asked.  Sometimes, materials will have mold on them, usually from exposure to water/moisture.  Separate the moldy stuff from the rest, and show it to the archivist-in-charge.  Sometimes, they will call in one of the curators to assess it and make a judgment about if it’s important enough to keep and send to Conservation for cleaning, or if it should be discarded.
