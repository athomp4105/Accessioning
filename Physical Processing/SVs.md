# SVs (Special Volumes)

Special volumes, or SVs, are volumes that are too big for or otherwise should not be stored in standard legal- or letter-sized folders.  Examples include scrapbooks, ledgers, and account books.  We usually store them flat.  Most of the time, we wrap them in paper.  Sometimes, if we anticipate the volume will be heavily used, we will put it in a box for easier access.  Occasionally, the volume is too big to be wrapped, and must be placed on the shelf as it is.  Other times, Conservation may make or order custom boxes specifically for a particular volume. 

## Wrapping Volumes

To supplement this written account of wrapping volumes, I created a video to demonstrate how to do it.  Hopefully, the video will fill in the gaps where my written explanation couldn't convey the technique.  It is in the Wilson Technical Services Sharepoint page, under "Departmental Documents", in the "TS Archival" folder: https://adminliveunc.sharepoint.com/sites/lib/departments/wts/Shared%20Documents/TS_Archival/Wrapping%20Volumes_Medium.mp4 

Wrapping volumes is similar to but different from gift-wrapping.  More paper is typically used to help protect from dust.  There is a big roll of acid-free paper that we use to wrap volumes.  You need a nice, big, open flat surface to work on.  BEFORE YOU WRAP:  Label the SV with its unique ID [ex: SV-01337/9], either by writing it directly on the item in brackets or on a slip of acid-free paper inserted just inside the front cover (recommended). 

Start by unrolling the paper roll 2 or 3 feet.  Place the volume on the paper such that you can gently fold (not crease) the end of the paper up and around to the opposite edge of the volume, covering the top.  The edge of the paper should be no more than a centimeter away from that opposite edge.  Now flip the volume and the end of the paper over towards the rest of the roll so it’s resting on its other cover.  This should cause the paper to wrap around the volume like a burrito.  Cut the paper just shy of the edge of the volume.  I like to start the cut with the volume lying flat to give myself a guideline, then I flip the volume back to the other side so I can keep cutting the paper. 

Once the cutting is done, pull the paper reasonably snug around the volume.  I like to have the “open” side face up.  It’s helpful to place something heavy on top to keep the paper in place.  Next you fold the end flaps up similar to how you’d gift-wrap a present, although there is typically way more paper here than when you’re gift-wrapping.  When both flaps are folded up, take your cotton ribbon and tie it around the volume to keep the flaps down, in the same criss-cross way you’d do for gift-wrapping.   The bow should be tied on one of the edges rather than on top, so it doesn’t interfere with stacking on the shelf.  I consider the bow edge the front edge. 

It is good practice to write the unique ID on 3 sides.  I do the bottom right corner of the top, the right side of the front edge, and the right side of the right edge.  This way, the item can be identified from multiple angles.
