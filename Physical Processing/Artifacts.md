# Artifacts, Framed and Rolled Items

## Artifacts

Up until here, I have only talked about paper.  However, sometimes you will come across artifacts.  I believe this will decrease in the future with the new accessioning system in place and developing, but it might be worth mentioning anyway.  In my experience, the archivist in charge has usually made most or all of the judgment calls regarding artifacts, including when it is necessary to ask the curators.  Usually, all I have to do is label the box.  From what I have seen, artifacts in a given collection are placed together in one (or how ever many) box(es).  If you come across artifacts that seem to have been overlooked, ask your archivist about it. 

Since writing the above, I have come across artifacts in the backlog work I’ve been doing.  Basically, I ask Jackie for help (she is archivist-in-charge for my backlog work).  Sometimes, she calls in one of the curators to come look at the stuff and see what should be kept and what should be discarded/returned to the donor. 

## Framed items

If the item is small enough to fit in a hollinger or paige box, it is generally advisable to house it in that.  However, if it's too big, or there is some other reason specific to that item, it might be best to deframe it.  I usually ask the archivist in charge first, and then we go from there.  We will often end up asking curatorial and conservation staff for a consult.  Generally, the curator answers questions like these: does the frame have research or artifactual value; if not, is the item worth the time/effort to deframe?  And, the conservator answers questions such as: is it safe for the item to be de-framed; and, what is the best way to house the item, deframed or not?  Conservation will also deframe the item for us if it's difficult to do. 

Please note:  **DO NOT DEFRAME DAGUERREOTYPES OR OTHER MULTI-LAYERED PHOTOGRAPHIC FORMATS**. 

## Rolled items

Occasionally, you will come across paper that has been tightly rolled for so long that it stays curly.  A lot of the time, they are oversized papers like posters or blueprints, but sometimes, smaller papers are rolled, too.  Whenever possible, we try to unroll them and store them flat in folders.  Some papers are more stubborn than others.  What we do is place them into folders, then weigh them down with something heavy for a few days (or a couple of weeks) to encourage them to lay flat.  They will often still be a little prone to curling, but after the initial flattening, it should be enough to be able to transfer them into boxes (or mapcase drawers if they are XOPs), where depending on the material, they will either have other things weighing down on them; or, if stored vertically, will have enough compression from the other materials in the box they’re stored with, plus the sides of the box holding everything together, to continue the flattening process in the stacks. 

If an item must remain rolled, the prefix for that is “R”.  Currently, what we are doing with them is up in the air.  We had a bunch that had built up recently, and put them away in a mapcase drawer.  They were all examples of items that remained rolled because of size.  I don’t know what we’ll do with smaller rolled items that must remain rolled for other reasons.  Nor do I know what is happening with rolled items that are too big for a mapcase, even rolled up.
