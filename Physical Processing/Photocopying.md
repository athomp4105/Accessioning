# Photocpying/Scanning

Sometimes, it is in our best interests to use the Multi-Function Device (MFD) when physically processing materials.  It can be quicker to make a copy of an enclosure than to transcribe all of the information written on it.  It can also provide a more accurate account of the information, especially if there is hard-to-read handwriting involved.  If there is something visual about the item that can't be transcribed, such as an icon/logo, something about the arrangement of the words, or countless other potential qualities difficult to think of on the spot, that's another good reason to photocopy.  In addition, if the item with the information is too big for a Paige or Hollinger box (such as a large manila envelope), or very bulky (like a bubble mailer), photocopying it allows you to "shrink it down" to a sheet or two of paper.  Note: You might not have to reduce the size of the scan if only a small section of a large item has relevant information. 

Our current MFD (Xerox Global Print Driver PCL6) also has a USB port, with which you can print directly from a USB drive.  I have tried a few times to get it to connect to my phone directly, with no luck.  Mine's an iPhone; I don't know if Android phones would have better luck.  That said, you can use your phone to take digital images of an item if scanning either isn't an option or not giving you a good enough quality image.  Then either you can print it from your computer or save it to a USB drive and plug that into the MFD and print it from there.  I am sure you could use a digital camera, too, although I have not.  I don't know if any or all cameras would connect directly with the MFD via USB, but the USB drive strategy would certainly work. 

A recent example where I used the MFD was a collection that arrived in letter boxes (03810. Couch).  The letter boxes had information about their contents written on them.  They were too unwieldy for the scanner, but I took pictures, saved them to a USB drive, plugged it into the MFD and printed color copies on acid-free, archival quality paper. 

Another example of MFD use was with a multi-page document from 05088. Boyer.  This document was printed/typed on paper with some kind of coating that flaked off in little pieces every time it was handled.  This was a great candidate for making photocopies on archival quality paper.  I used the flatbed section of the scanner rather than try to use the feeder.  Now we have a usable copy that will not visibly deteriorate just from being picked up. 

## How to Make a Photocopy

**1.** If the screen is blank and the ring of light around the power button is blinking, press the power button to wake up the MFD. 

**2.** If you place paper in the bypass tray, a screen will pop up to confirm the paper type in the bypass tray.  Make any changes if necessary, and when it looks good, press "OK". 

**3.** Select "Copy" button on screen. 

**4.** Place the item you want to copy on the flatbed.  If possible, line it up with the top-left corner (the one with the green arrow pointing inward at it).  If not possible, just try to center it within the 8.5x11 section so it doesn't get cut off in the scan. 

**5.** You might want to make a test copy on normal paper first if you're looking to make an archival paper copy to see if you need to move the item, what settings might need adjusting, etc.   

**6.** Choose your settings.  The ones I find most important most of the time are: 

  - Number of copies. 
  - 1- or 2-sided. 
  - Black-and-white or color. 
  - Paper supply – I find if I'm using the bypass tray, it pays to change this from "Auto-Select" to "Bypass Tray" so it doesn't wind up using Tray 1. 
  - Reduce/Enlarge as necessary. 
  - Original size – this setting controls how much of the flatbed is scanned.  It starts you on "Default size", which seems to be 8.5x11 inches (letter size).  It appears to me if you need to scan a larger area than that, your best bet is to click into "Original Size", then "Custom/Presets", and increase the length that will be included in the scan (the scannable area is 12 inches long).  It lets you increase it to 14 inches, but my best guess is that's for the feeder (but that really is just a guess). 
  - Any other settings, like Darken or Saturation, that you might need to make relevant information stand out or be legible. 
  - If you're still not satisfied, you can find even more settings if you scroll all the way down.  Press "Customize", then select "Feature List."  Click the eyeball icons to add/remove a particular setting from the settings list.  Click "OK" to save your changes and dive into your new adjustments. 

**7.** When you're ready, hit "Start". 

**8.** Every time the MFD scans a sheet, a message will pop up that says it's "complete".  Just press okay on that and continue to make whatever other copies you need. 

**9.** When you're done, you can either just leave it as it is or hit the physical "Home" button (it has a house icon on it), and it will revert back to the main menu screen.  Remove the original(s) from the flatbed and take your new print-out(s).  Recycle imperfect copies you don't need to keep. 

## How to Print from USB Drive*

*I imagine if you could get your phone or camera to connect to the MFD, the directions would be largely similar.

**1.** If the screen is blank and the ring of light around the power button is blinking, press the power button to wake up the MFD. 

**2.** If you place paper in the bypass tray, a screen will pop up to confirm the paper type in the bypass tray.  Make any changes if necessary, and when it looks good, press "OK". 

**3.** Insert your USB drive into the USB port. 

**4.** A message should pop up that reads, "USB drive has been detected" - select "Print from USB". 

**5.** Browse your USB drive on the MFD's screen and select the files you want to print. 

**6.** Choose your settings.  This is much a much shorter list than for photocopying. 

  - Number of copies, black/white or color, 1- or 2-sided like for photocopying. 
  - Paper supply – I find if I'm using the bypass tray, it pays to change this from "Auto-Select" to "Bypass Tray" so it doesn't wind up using Tray 1. 

**7.** If you want to select more files, press the "Add Document" button at the top of the screen.  If you don't see it on the screen, scroll up until you do. 

**8.** When ready, hit "Print". 

**9.** Repeat as you need. 

**10.** When you're done, hit the physical "Home" button (it has a house icon on it), and it will revert back to the main menu screen.  Remove your USB drive and take your new print-out(s).  Recycle imperfect copies you don't need to keep.
