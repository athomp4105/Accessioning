# Z Collections

Z collections are small collections that are 5 or fewer folders.  They are housed in shared boxes, stored in collection # order.  Processing them is very similar to larger paper collections.  When numbering the folders, it’s helpful to number them 1 of X, 2 of X, 3 of X, etc. 

There are a few categories of Zs:  SHC-z, SFC-z, and the z image boxes, to name a few.  Z image boxes are also broken up into SHC-z image, SFC-z image, etc, and I think that system is staying for now.  Relatively new as of this writing are the z negative boxes.  Photos are a little bit in flux.  Maybe by the time someone is reading this, there will be hard and fast rules. 

When you add a Z to a Z box, it can be as simple as dropping the folder in, or you might have a shifting project on your hands if the box is too full.  Either way, make sure the collection number ranges written on the outside of the box match the contents of the box, and record changes you make so you can either edit the locations database or pass along the changes to whoever is the one who edits the locations database. 

Note: many of the older z box labels are covered in packing tape.   We no longer do this.  The intent was good – to protect the labels from damage - but it poses a problem if the range of collections housed in that box changes.  In cases like this, we use an address label (like Avery 5160) to cover up the old range and write the new range on. 

If you’re making a new Z box, use one of the pre-printed labels in the folder in the TS workroom (the same one the OB labels are in).  Once again, this helps us keep track of what number we’re up to.  

Here you can see the SHC z box labels:

They are affixed to the box like so:

If you need to make more, the template for the big labels can be found here:  G:\wilson\ts\archival\labels\Box Labels OneLibrary SHC Z newtemp 

And there is currently no template for the small labels with the box numbers on them. 

Here is an SFC z box label, in the old style:

And it looks like this on the box:

There is currently no up-to-date template for SFC z box labels.
