# Oversize Papers and Photographs

There are a few sizes to choose from.  Try to use the smallest size possible, so the papers don't slide around more than they have to, and so they’re a little easier to handle; those big sizes can be awkward.  The “normal” oversize papers are called OPFs and XOPFs, and the oversize photographs are called OP-PFs and XOP-PFs.  We have two current sizes of OP/PFs, and XOP/PFs go in the map case drawers.  XOP/PFs can be awkward to handle, so it's not uncommon to ask for help in putting them away.  There is also a “taco cart” near the research room that you can borrow if it’s available, as long as you bring it back promptly when you’re finished; the research room needs it for paging.  Occasionally, you might come across the “legacy” size of 16x20 inches, which is smaller than the smaller current OPFs we use.  Photographs may use this size more often than “normal” papers currently, but to be honest, I am not 100% sure about that; I don’t typically handle nearly as many OP-PFs as I do OPFs. 

When writing information on oversize folders, the opening of the folder should face you.  Write the folder number near the  bottom-right corner, and the collection name and number underneath.  [Folder # example:  OPF-02644/5]  When you put away the OP/PF, add the shelf coordinates to the same bottom left corner, underneath the other information.  Consistency is especially appreciated for oversize materials; if one can flip through one corner of them and be able to identify each folder by looking at one small area, it makes paging go a lot more smoothly. 

We usually put OPFs in shared oversize boxes (OBs) in the stacks.  OP-PFs are a little bit in flux.  They will probably also still end up in OBs in the stacks. 

We pre-print labels for these boxes and keep them in a folder in the TS workroom. 

Here is what the folder looks like:

And here is an example of some preprinted labels:

This helps us keep track of what number we’re up to, so we don’t repeat a box number (or skip one, although repeating is worse).  What I like to do is trim the labels with an Xacto knife and straight edge – I cut off the excess white right underneath the big box number.  I don’t know how visible it is in the picture above, but 426 and 427 have been Xactoed, and the other sheets have not.  I do this for two reasons: to make the box number part fit better on the side of the box, and to create a smaller blank label for placing on top of the lid.  The box number goes on the short side of the box.  Have the box number facing you and look at the top of the lid.  The blank label should go on the bottom right corner. 

Example:

We generally store “normal” oversize papers and oversize photographs in separate boxes, although the boxes are kept in the same area (at least for now... there may be changes afoot).  When you put a new OP/PF in an OB, add the OP/PF number to the label on the top of the lid.  This is for convenience when paging, and believe me, every little bit helps when you’re trying to page OPFs.  Similarly, if you’re putting a new XOP/PF in a mapcase drawer, add the XOP/PF number to the label on the drawer.
