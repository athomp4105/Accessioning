# Seperately Maintained Additions

## Additions at the End

The quickest way to handle additions is usually to add them on to the end of the finding aid with no arrangement or intellectual integration of the material.  In the first example, there are three additions, one in March 2008, one in January 2012, and one in February 2017. Sometimes there is material that overlaps with the original deposit and sometimes there is new material that does not.  The second example is a full-blown finding aid in which all of the changes are bolded. 

If the contents list begins to get unwieldy and hard to penetrate, think about going the route of integrated additions.

## Alerting Researchers to Additions

With separately maintained additions, it's good practice to warn researchers that they will need to look in the collection's additions to find all the materials that they need. Include a note indicating this as the last paragraph of your scope and content note.  

_Example of a collection level scope content note alerting researchers about additions:_

These papers consist chiefly of family letters from the 1790s through the early 1860s. Correspondence of the family with outsiders had been almost entirely excluded from the collection, but family letters were deliberately preserved as a "family record" (see Ellen Mordecai's letters of October-November 1854). The Addition of January 2007 includes personal letters between family members; 1816 letters by Maria Edgeworth and Richard Lovell Edgeworth responding to Rachel Mordecai Lazarus's letter concerning Edgeworth's literary treatment of Jews; and reminiscences, song lyrics, and fragments. The Addition of September 2007 includes letters written to and by Mordecai family members, 1865 and 1916-1917, and one poem dated 1945. The Addition of December 2007 contains the three-volume "A Memoir of Maria Edgeworth with a Selection from Her Letters by the late Mrs. Edgeworth" (unpublished) with accompanying notes tipped in.  

Additions received after 1979 have not been integrated into the original deposits. Researchers should always check additions to be sure they have identified all files of interest to them.
